* ==============================================================
* Name: Savin, Fall 2020
* Section: M6A
* Project: Final Project - Hangman
* Description: Hangman game using the console for inputs and a file for outputs
* Documentation Statement: I used the interntet to find how to return 
* multiple values of different types using 1 function and I dicovered I can return a struct.
* ==============================================================
* UserManual/Instructions:
*   In order to use this programme you need to input different letters in
* the console in order to find the word that was randomly selected when
* you first ran the programme. If the letter you input is wrong the 
* programme will start drowing a hanged man.
 *
 *  Bonus Features (upto 10 pts) - List here
 *  1)
 *  2)
 *  3)
 *
 *  Required Programming Skills (must have 5 of 6):
 *   1) Dynamic Memory Allocation
 *          What you did to meet this req: xxx
 *              File: (file where example is located)
 *              Line#: (line in file where it is located)
 *   2) Pointers
 *          What you did to meet this req: I used pointers to return an array from a function
 *              File:finalmain.c
 *              Line#:10
 *   3) File I/O
 *          What you did to meet this req: input from the dictionary
 *              File:finalfuncts.c
 *              Line#:13-21
 *   4) Structs
 *          What you did to meet this req: created a struct to use for the output of the word
 *              File: finalmain.c
 *              Line#:1-6
 *
 *   5) String Manipulation
 *          What you did to meet this req: the entire game is about string manipulation
 *              File:finalfuncts.c
 *              Line#:almost all of them
 *
 *   6) Processing of Array Data
 *          What you did to meet this req: returned all the positions of where a letter occured in the word using an array
 *              File:finalfuncts.c
 *              Line#:68
 *
 *  Required Advanced Programming Skills (1 or more):
 *   1) Recursion
 *          What you did to meet this req: used recursion to ask for input until it respects the format
 *              File: finalfuncts.c
 *              Line#: 42
 *
 *   2) 2D Dynamic Memory
 *          What you did to meet this req: xxx
 *              File:
 *              Line#:
 *
 *   3) Graphics - Curses or Win32
 *          What you did to meet this req: xxx
 *              File:
 *              Line#:
 *
 *   List any changes or omissions from stated shall requirements (from
