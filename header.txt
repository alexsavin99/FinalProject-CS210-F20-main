* Project: Final Project - name of your project
* Description: 
* Documentation Statement: I used the interntet to find how to return

* ==============================================================
* UserManual/Instructions:
*   In order to use this programme you need to input different letters in

 *   4) Structs
 *          What you did to meet this req: created a struct to use for the output of the word
 *              File: finalmain.c
 *              Line#:1-6
 *
 *   5) String Manipulation
 *          What you did to meet this req: the entire game is about string manipulation
